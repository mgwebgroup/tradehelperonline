Yasumi
==========

Yasumi (Japanese for 'Holiday') is an easy PHP library to help you calculate the dates and names of holidays and other
special celebrations from various countries/states. Many services exist on the internet that provide holidays, however
are either not free or offer only limited information. In addition, no complete PHP library seems to exist today
that covers a wide range of holidays and countries, except maybe [PEAR's Date_Holidays](https://pear.php.net/package/Date_Holidays) 
which unfortunately hasn't been updated for a long time.

The goal of Yasumi is to be powerful while remaining lightweight, by utilizing PHP native classes wherever possible.
Yasumi's calculation is provider-based (i.e. by country/state) so it is easy to add new holiday providers that calculate
holidays. The methods of Yasumi can be used to get a holiday's date and name in various languages.

```


Basic Usage<a name="usage"></a>
-------

```php
<?php
// Require the composer auto loader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Yasumi\Yasumi;
use Yasumi\Filters\OfficialHolidaysFilter;

// Use the factory to create a new holiday provider instance
$holidays = Yasumi::create('USA', 2016);

// Get the number of defined holidays
echo $holidays->count() . PHP_EOL;
// 11

// Get a list all of the holiday names (short names)
foreach ($holidays->getHolidayNames() as $name) {
    echo $name . PHP_EOL;

Testing<a name="testing"></a>
-------

Yasumi has a [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) test suite. To run the tests, run the following command from the project 
folder:

``` bash
$ phpunit
```

Yasumi has over 1200 unit tests with multiple iterations of assertions. Since Yasumi is using randomized years for asserting
the holidays, multiple iterations of assertions are executed to ensure the holidays are calculated in a large number
of years.

The tests are organized in some test suites to make testing a bit more easier:

* "Base"          : For testing the base functionality of Yasumi
* "Belgium"       : For separately testing the Belgium Holiday Provider
* "Brazil"        : For separately testing the Brazil Holiday Provider
* "Croatia"       : For separately testing the Croatia Holiday Provider
* "CzechRepublic" : For separately testing the Czech Republic Holiday Provider
* "Denmark"       : For separately testing the Denmark Holiday Provider
* "Finland"       : For separately testing the Finland Holiday Provider
* "France"        : For separately testing the France Holiday Provider
* "Germany"       : For separately testing the Germany Holiday Provider
* "Greece"        : For separately testing the Greece Holiday Provider
* "Italy"         : For separately testing the Italy Holiday Provider
* "Japan"         : For separately testing the Japan Holiday Provider
* "Netherlands"   : For separately testing the Netherlands Holiday Provider
* "NewZealand"    : For separately testing the New Zealand Holiday Provider
* "Norway"        : For separately testing the Norway Holiday Provider
* "Poland"        : For separately testing the Poland Holiday Provider
* "Spain"         : For separately testing the Spain Holiday Provider
* "Sweden"        : For separately testing the Sweden Holiday Provider
* "USA"           : For separately testing the USA Holiday Provider
* "UnitedKingdom" : For separately testing the United Kingdom Holiday Provider

Contributions are encouraged and welcome; we are always happy to get feedback or even pull requests. 
In order to keep the code consistent, please use the following command after your completed work:

``` bash
$ composer php-cs-fixer
```

This will check/correct all the code for the PSR-2 Coding Standard using the wonderful [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) .

If you like to add a new Holiday Provider, the best starting point is to use on of the existing holiday providers. There
are a few things to keep consider:

1. Ensure your new Holiday Provider contains all the necessary unit tests.
2. Next to the file '<REGIONNAME>BaseTestCase.php', a file called '<REGIONNAME>Test.php' needs to be present. This file
   needs to include region/country level tests and requires assertion of all expected holidays.
3. All the unit tests and the implementation Holiday Provider require to have the correct locale, timezone and
   region/country name.
4. As almost all of the tests use automatic iterations, make sure the year for which the test is executed is a valid 
   year. Some holidays are only established from a certain year and having the test year number smaller than the minimum
   establishment year (amongst all holidays) can result in false errors.
